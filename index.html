            Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a
            'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.
            Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from countries such as Togo, Ivory Coast and
            Ghana.
            A child’s name is determined by factors surrounding his or her birth. For example, the day of their birth
            or the
            manner in which they were born may determine which name they get irrespective of their gender.
